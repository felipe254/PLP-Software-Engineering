1.	Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is crucial because:
•	It ensures customer satisfaction and maintains trust.
•	Delays can lead to increased costs, missed market opportunities, and reputational damage.
•	It aligns with business goals and stakeholder expectations.
To ensure deadlines are met, project managers can:
•	Break the project into smaller tasks using a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
•	Use Gantt charts to visualize timelines and dependencies.
•	Allocate resources effectively and monitor progress regularly.
•	Implement Agile methodologies for iterative delivery and flexibility.
•	Identify and mitigate risks early to avoid delays.

2.	How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control ensures:
•	The project stays within financial constraints, maximizing ROI.
•	Resources are allocated efficiently, avoiding waste.
•	Stakeholder confidence is maintained.
Strategies to prevent budget overruns:
•	Conduct thorough cost estimation during planning.
•	Use earned value management (EVM) to track budget vs. progress.
•	Prioritize features using MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have) analysis.
•	Regularly review and adjust the budget based on project progress.
•	Implement Agile practices to deliver incremental value and adjust scope as needed.

3.	Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile:
•	Advantages:
o	Flexible and adaptable to changes.
o	Delivers incremental value through iterations.
o	Encourages collaboration and customer feedback.
•	Disadvantages:
o	Requires active stakeholder involvement.
o	Can lack clear documentation.
o	May struggle with large, complex projects.
Waterfall:
•	Advantages:
o	Clear structure with defined phases.
o	Easy to manage and document.
o	Suitable for projects with fixed requirements.
•	Disadvantages:
o	Inflexible to changes once the project starts.
o	Delays testing until the end, increasing risk.
o	Less customer involvement during development.
4.	In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is beneficial for:
•	Projects with evolving requirements (e.g., mobile app development).
•	Startups or innovative products needing frequent feedback (e.g., a new SaaS platform).
•	Teams that value collaboration and adaptability.
Waterfall is beneficial for:
•	Projects with fixed, well-defined requirements (e.g., regulatory compliance software).
•	Large-scale infrastructure projects (e.g., building an ERP system).
•	Teams that prefer structured, phase-based approaches.

5.	What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for QA:
•	Implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
•	Conduct regular code reviews and unit testing.
•	Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to validate functionality.
•	Use automated testing tools for efficiency.
•	Adhere to coding standards and best practices.
Importance of high standards:
•	Ensures the software is reliable, secure, and user-friendly.
•	Reduces bugs and technical debt, saving time and costs.
•	Enhances customer satisfaction and trust.

6.	How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope:
•	Clarifies objectives, deliverables, and boundaries.
•	Prevents scope creep and ensures alignment with stakeholder expectations.
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
•	A hierarchical decomposition of the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
Useful because:
o	Organizes work and assigns responsibilities.
o	Facilitates accurate cost and time estimation.
o	Provides a clear roadmap for execution.

7.	What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits of a detailed schedule:
•	Provides a clear timeline for task completion.
•	Helps allocate resources efficiently.
•	Tracks progress and identifies delays early.
Gantt charts assist by:
•	Visualizing task dependencies and timelines.
•	Highlighting critical paths and milestones.
•	Enabling real-time progress tracking and adjustments.

8.	What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Core issues:
•	Inefficient workflows, lack of automation, or poor user experience.
•	Data security vulnerabilities or compliance challenges.
•	Limited scalability or integration with existing systems.
Significance:
•	These issues hinder productivity, increase costs, and reduce customer satisfaction.
•	Addressing them provides tangible value, such as time savings, improved security, or enhanced user engagement.

9.	How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
•	Ensures the solution aligns with user needs and business goals.
•	Guides feature prioritization and resource allocation.
•	Reduces the risk of building unnecessary or irrelevant functionality.
•	Provides a clear benchmark for measuring success.
